# Driverless-car-assistance
Provide a developer-friendly ADAS stack that demonstrates lane segmentation, object detection (cars, pedestrians, signs), simple behavioral rules (slow on red zone, warn on obstacles), and an optional auto-mode where the system outputs steering/throttle commands for a compatible controller or simulator.
